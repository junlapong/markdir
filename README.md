# markdir

Markdir serves up a directory of files in HTML, rendering Markdown files into HTML when they are encountered as `.md` files.
It's sort of the most degenerate Wiki you could imagine writing short of simply having static HTML files.

    go get -u github.com/junlapong/markdir

    Usage of markdir:
      -bind string
          listen host:port (default "localhost:1404")
